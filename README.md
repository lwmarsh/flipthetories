## Flip the Tories!
 A simple tactical vote indicator built in PHP that allows visitors to find out who they should vote for if they want to get rid of the Tory party.

 A live version can be found [here](https://flipthetories.co.uk/).

All the data is kindly borrowed from [tactical.vote](https://tactical.vote/). More detailed information on who (not) to vote for and why can be found on their website -- this project is merely just a demo.

###### "Flip" is used in the US to denote a state [switching party](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/flip#Verb) in an election.
