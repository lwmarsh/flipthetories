## Flip the Tories!
 A simple tactical vote indicator built in PHP that allows visitors to find out who they should vote for if they want to get rid of the Tory party.

All the data is kindly borrowed from [tactical.vote](https://tactical.vote/). More detailed information on who (not) to vote for and why can be found on their website -- this project is merely just a demo.

###### "Flip" is a very convenient bowdlerisation of a far more appropriate word... but is also used in the US to denote a state [switching party](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/flip#Verb) in an election.
